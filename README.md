This code was first based on the original Ruby Mode distributed with 
SubEthaEdit 2.0a. It was then extracted from Coda 1.7.3 and updated as 
the core of Coda fell behind SubEthaEdit in terms of support.

## Overview

This is a syntax highlighting mode for Ruby under Coda 1.7.3. I found the
mode bundled with Coda 1.7.3 to be out of date and missing quite a few 
simple syntax features and decided to add them in. Coming from a Rails
background, primarily using TextMate for the past few years, I intend to
get things rolling a little in that direction.

With that in mind I'll be removing some auto-completion from this mode
and creating a partner Rails mode for auto-completion and functionality
specific to Rails.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to install this mode is to clone the repository into:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Coda/Modes/

You must quit and restart Coda to get the mode to load. You will see this
mode as "Ruby" in the Mode menu, and it will take over the handling of
Ruby-related files automatically.

It can also easily be uninstalled be removing that folder and restarting
Coda, in the event it does break something.

This software is, to my knowledge, free of any defects, however if you 
choose to use it you do so at your own discretion. Neither myself (Michael
Prins), Jeff Reinecke nor the authors of SubEthaEdit, as well as the 
distributors of the Ruby Mode, Coda or SubEthaEdit can be held responsible
for any damages that this software may cause.

This syntax coloring mode may be freely distributed and/or modified as
you wish, providing that

1. credit be given to both myself (Michael Prins), Jeff Reinecke and to the 
authors of SubEthaEdit for our contributions, and

2. that since this is a derivative work of the authors of SubEthaEdit and
Jeff Reinecke, they still retain copyright for the portions they wrote, and 
thus have the right to stop distribution of this syntax coloring mode and any 
derivative work that still contains portions of the original Ruby syntax
coloring mode that this is based upon.

If you have any questions, comments, feature requests, et cetera, feel free to
look up the issue and/or report it in the issue tracker if it isn't already 
there. I will try my best to add things that are reasonable and useful.
